# DC Mini Logs

I made this to hold myself accountable and remember what the hell I've been up to since landing in Taipei. I know the days can get blurry quickly, I'll forget what I've done, handle a million small (but important) tasks that feel like they lead nowhere. Maybe you, as a reader, have some suggestions for how I can structure my time, approach my project, present it to the world.
