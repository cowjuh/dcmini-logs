*This is technically July 1st in PST time*

I fly to Taipei in 2 hours. I'm terrified. I'm going completely alone. My DJI Pocket 2's gimbal broke from falling off the bed. It's acting erratically now, complaining about overheating, contorting itself.

对自己做的决定永远不完全自信。台北是不是对我来说太简单了？应不应该直接去深圳？电气学明白了吗？我能行吗？不能怎么想。千万不能怎么想。不能一个人闯出去的时候怎么想。一定要有自信。

今天早上七点半跟Uber司机开始聊天。聊着在UBC上大学。他是Sauder毕业的。是成都人。我小时候不敢和陌生人聊天。纽约住三年后完全改变了我的性格。发现是个中国人就立刻问 ”Can you speak Chinese?"。几个特别的单词不会的时候就大胆地问。“什么意思？“ 他就会找方法来解释。下车之前，我把他的微信扫了一下。
