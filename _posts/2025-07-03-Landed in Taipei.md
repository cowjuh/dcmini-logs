## Log

**5AM**
- Land from 12h flight. Feeling insane
- Get a bunch of CASH $$$$
- Overcome anxiety of ordering food at a stall in the airport. Somehow whether or not they accept credit cards is scary to me. Everything is scary at first. Also I barely slept.

**9:00AM**
- Decide to transit instead of Ubering for the views. Figured out MRT system along the way. Very cute transit cards here.

**10:00AM**
- Check in to Airbnb
- Unpack, hang clothes up.

**1:30PM**
- First 7-11 trip. It's so fucking sick hell yeah. Had to buy a towel cause the Airbnb didn't have any. What's up with that...
- Stroll around. The heat is oppressive. Need sunscreen.
- Overcome fear/embarrassment of wearing Meta Raybans everywhere. Start recording almost every second of my time here.

**4:30PM**
- Pass out

## Thoughts
- I'm writing this one retroactively and am not able to capture how confused I felt navigating the city at first.
- I'm actively avoiding speaking English and choosing to translate text using my phone first even if I could just choose to say it in English.
- The city is really, really cute. People are dressed very casually.
- The MRT is very quiet.
