## Log

**5AM**
- Land from flight. Feeling insane

**9:00AM**
- Decide to transit instead of Ubering for the views. Figured out MRT system along the way. Very cute transit cards here.

**10:00AM**
- Check in to Airbnb
- Unpack, hang clothes up.

**1:30PM**
- First 7-11 trip. It's so fucking sick hell yeah.
- Stroll around. The heat is oppressive. Need sunscreen.
- Overcome fear/embarrassment of wearing Meta Raybans everywhere. Start recording almost every second of my time here.

**4:30PM**
- Pass out
