## Thoughts
- Overcame several fears/uncertainties
	- Bike rentals
	- Guanghua plaza, asking for components in Chinese
	- Vlogging the whole day with Meta Raybans on
	- Overcoming exhaustion and going to Fablab without know how it'd be
	- Being annoying enough to knock repeatedly on Fablab's door to then meet Haomin and get access
