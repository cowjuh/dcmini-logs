## Log

**6AM** 
- Wake up, shower
- Import Meta Raybans footage
	- Ran into issue where footage wasn't ordered correctly, blocked me for a while as I figured out the Kingston -> WD Black
	- Wrote a script with cursor to copy the "Date Modified" property over to the "Creation Date" property of each imported file
- Record 4 versions of my intro to this project
	- Edit one of the versions into the longer video
	- Chop up longer video to be faster paced, include section where I break my DJI
- Edited Meta Raybans footage for a bit
- Chatted with Josie for a bit

**12PM**
- Get some food, 3 steamed buns and a smoothie
- Bike ~40 minutes in sweltering heat over to Fablab
- Guy who runs the space isn't there, meander around Fablab for 30 minutes

**2PM**
- Enter Fablab
- Get ESP32Cam hooked up again
- Research where to buy OV cameras with longer ribbons so I can attach them
- Shopee shopping cart figured out
	- Blocker: Need a Taiwanese phone number
- Download Autodesk Fusion

**5:30PM**
- Looking to leave Fablab soon
- Hao-min teaches me how to lock up the space which is crazy to me bro just trusts some random girl he met yesterday with these instructions
- Bought eyedrops

**7:30PM**
- First solo sit-down restaurant: Random beef place
- Taiwanese fried chicken at night market
- Transit back

**9:30PM**
- Pass out

## Thoughts
- Overcame several fears/uncertainties
	- Ordering food from a stall in Chinese and saying characters incorrectly
	- Reading Chinese characters in order to order food
	- Pointing Pleco up at the menu and looking stupid to read the Chinese characters
	- Pulled out my ESP32 Cam + breadboard + other sensors box in front of Hao-min who was building an avant-garde Pleko board with pressure sensors and a 7 segment LCD display
	- Receiving critical feedback on the way I present myself in my video and not taking offense.
- Mental fortitude
	- Saw someone with a really stacked portfolio and resume, felt down, got over it
	- Overwhelmed by what I need to get done to make this thing exist, still doing it
	- Not yet feeling lonely
