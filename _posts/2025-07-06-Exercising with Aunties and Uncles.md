## Log
**5:30AM**
- Wake up
- Shower
- Attempt to order parts off Shopee, fail
	- Need a Taiwanese phone number.

**7:30AM**
- Eat leftover steamed bun
- Visit coffee shop, receive a free drink
    - Barista starts playing a Joe Hisaishi soundtrack for one of the Ghibli movies. Did I just get profiled? He clocked me.
- Walk over to the park, it's a SUNDAY!

**8:30AM**
- Run into aunties and uncles exercising, join in
- One aunty in particular takes a liking to me and is very verbose (non-derogatory) about explaining how to do each movement. I am deeply grateful to her.

**10:00AM**
- Bathroom break
- Bike back home
- Video + editing
	- One video for digicam.mini Instagram
	- One video for twitter
	- Re-record intro video
- Explore HuggingFace image to 3D model (considering using for content series)
- Fix Meta Raybans metadata script to ignore files that already had their metadata fixed

**4:30**
- Forgot to eat lunch. Very bad, need to eat.
- Editing takes. A. Long. Time.
- Had dinner, talked to a sweet lady whose 28 year old son is studying electronics, got her contacts
    - Aunties seem to like talking to me
- Went on a long walk through the city, bought panna cotta
- Biked to eslite 24h bookstore, spent some time there
    - Tons of books in Chinese that I cannot read. I'm left feeling sad but upon reflection should feel excitement at the overwhelming amount of material I can start understanding once I can generally read more characters.
	- I've been reading《解忧杂货店》东野圭吾 on Pleco which I found on some guy's repo of presumably pirated epubs. [Link](https://github.com/zhoulujun/iBook-ebook/blob/master/%E3%80%8A%E8%A7%A3%E5%BF%A7%E6%9D%82%E8%B4%A7%E5%BA%97%E3%80%8B%E4%B8%9C%E9%87%8E%E5%9C%AD%E5%90%BE.epub)
	    - After the initial confusion of character names, new terminology, etc, it actually becomes an easy read. You start seeing recurring words, patterns in the author's writing, and it becomes kind of a great way to drill these characters into your brain through repeated exposure.

**9:30**
- Biked home, turned on the TV for the first time
- Imported + reviewed footage

## Thoughts
- Braveries
	- Working out with aunties and uncles is hard
- As much time as it took I think getting the right voice for this intro video is important and I think I found it. It will set the tone
- I'm happy to be able to explore tech and open source projects and think about how to integrate them into my videos.
- Josie warns me not to overdo it on the content, I agree
