## Log
**5:30AM**
- Wake up
- Shower
- Attempt to order parts off Shopee, fail
	- Need a Taiwanese phone number.

**7:30AM**
- Eat leftover steamed bun
- Visit coffee shop, receive a free drink
    - Barista starts playing a Joe Hisaishi soundtrack for one of the Ghibli movies. Did I just get profiled? He clocked me.
- Walk over to the park, it's a SUNDAY!

**8:30AM**
- Run into aunties and uncles exercising, join in
- One aunty in particular takes a liking to me and is very verbose (non-derogatory) about explaining how to do each movement. I am deeply grateful to her.

**10:00AM**
- Bathroom break
- Bike back home
- Video + editing
	- One video for digicam.mini Instagram
	- One video for twitter
	- Re-record intro video
- Explore HuggingFace image to 3D model (considering using for content series)
- Fix Meta Raybans metadata script to ignore files that already had their metadata fixed

**4:30**
- Forgot to eat lunch. Very bad, need to eat.
- Editing takes. A. Long. Time.
- Had dinner, talked to a sweet lady whose 28 year old son is studying electronics, got her contacts
    - Aunties seem to like talking to me
- Went on a long walk through the city, bought panna cotta
- Biked to eslite 24h bookstore, spent some time there

**9:30**
- Biked home, turned on the TV for the first time
- Imported + reviewed footage

## Thoughts
- Braveries
	- Working out with aunties and uncles is hard
- As much time as it took I think getting the right voice for this intro video is important and I think I found it. It will set the tone
- I'm happy to be able to explore tech and open source projects and think about how to integrate them into my videos.
- Josie warns me not to overdo it on the content, I agree
