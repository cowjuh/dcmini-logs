## Todo
- Get Taiwanese number from Chunghwa
- Go back to electronics market to ask for OV5640 with longer ribbons

## Log

**7AM**
- Shower, get ready
- Tidy up apartment
- Bike over to the park to meet with uncles and aunties for morning exercise

**8:15AM**
- I don't see them
- Starts raining
- As I'm about to leave I see them and join in
- One uncle talks to me about *the state of the world*.

**9:30AM**
- Visit a cafe/coworking space that costs 150NT to work out of for 3-4 hours. Not bad
- Sitting on the 3rd floor facing a window. It's raining.
- I forgot my earbuds but it's ok. Relinquish control.
- I set up this website on Github Pages and organize existing logs.

**11:46AM**
- I'm hungry.
- Hao min is not in town so I won't have access to Fablab. Need to check out Maker Lab instead which is closer anyways.
- Annoyed at the amount of project overhead needed (video format, vlogging style, ensuring metadata is correct for footage import, my on-camera personality, GETTING USED TO BEING IN TAIWAN LOL, this website, where to get parts.)

**1:48PM**
- Refreshed on elec knowledge, feels good to read textbooks
    - Also feels good to not feel pressure to record while I'm doing a "mundane" activity
    - Inability to vlog, talk, listen to music is causing me to be quite focused
- Getting food

**2:55PM**
- SLAMMED A HOT DOG BUN 
- I think about why this POV format compels me. Why I stopped caring about cinematic posed shots. I think my answer is simply that people lack the attention span to enjoy it. You'd be doing it for yourself and no one else which is a good enough reason to do anything. You could say it's the only reason to do anything. Propping my camera up on a table across from mine, hopping back to my seat, pretending I don't see the camera... not a dance I'm willing to do anymore. Give me the RAW STUFF. The A-roll. The stuff I see with my eyes for real. Not what I manufacture for aesthetics. Give me the STORY.
- Eating pasta at Beppin Pasta. It's good.

**3:40PM**
- They do not have the camera sensor I'm lookin for on any of the Guanghua plaza floors, nor inside JinHua. I asked if any other stores carry them and th JinHua clerk just shook her head.
- Ok. SIM card to be able to buy off Shopee it is then.
- Passed by arts & crafts store. Bought prototyping materials totalling to $8USD. Would have cost $20 in the US. 
- Chunghwa eSIM purchased and installed
- Start biking home

**5:15PM**
- Home. Eat a panna cotta.
- PURCHASE THE PARTS I NEED FROM SHOPEE NOW THAT I HAVE A PHONE NUMBER GOD BLESSSSSSS
- Turns out Shopee has a ton of other interesting shiny distracting things but I don't buy anything
- Waste time
- [This vinyl is fucking sick](https://youtu.be/DIiZaNmo5qI?si=n0KYAWvfaMTV_hEm)

**8:00PM**
- Leave house. Buy 1 single skewer.
- Walk to late night coffee shop. It's full.
- Walk to another one. Sit down and do work.

**10:00PM**
- Still at late night cafe. Call with [REDACTED]
- Reels format research + design. Video game inspired.
