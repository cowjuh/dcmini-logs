## Todo
- Get Taiwanese number from Chunghwa
- Go back to electronics market to ask for OV5640 with longer ribbons

## Log

**7AM**
- Shower, get ready
- Tidy up apartment
- Bike over to the park to meet with uncles and aunties for morning exercise

**8:15AM**
- I don't see them
- Starts raining
- As I'm about to leave I see them and join in
- One uncle talks to me about *the state of the world*.

**9:30AM**
- Visit a cafe/coworking space that costs 150NT to work out of for 3-4 hours. Not bad
- Sitting on the 3rd floor facing a window. It's raining.
- I forgot my earbuds but it's ok. Relinquish control.
- I set up this website on Github Pages and organize existing logs.

**11:46AM**
- I'm hungry.
- Hao min is not in town so I won't have access to Fablab. Need to check out Maker Lab instead which is closer anyways.
- Annoyed at the amount of project overhead needed (video format, vlogging style, ensuring metadata is correct for footage import, my on-camera personality, GETTING USED TO BEING IN TAIWAN LOL, this website, where to get parts.)

**1:48PM**
- Refreshed on elec knowledge, feels good to read textbooks
    - Also feels good to not feel pressure to record while I'm doing a "mundane" activity
    - Inability to vlog, talk, listen to music is causing me to be quite focused
- Getting food
