## Todo
- Update iPad OS
- Shapr3D setup across devices
- Basic 3D case design to shove my camera into
- A jingle/repeatable sound effect to intro each video. Pavlov if you will.
- Gym membership
- Telegram PapurikaBot

## Log

**7:00AM**
- Wake up and shower
- This blog as a format will become outdated soon. Doing a 3 hour sprint to get a telegram bot that I can text my stream of consciousness.
- Updating iPad, onboarding to Shapr3D. It's nice and intuitive so far.
