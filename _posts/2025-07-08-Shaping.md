## Log

**7:00AM**
- Wake up and shower
- This blog as a format will become outdated soon. Doing a 3 hour sprint to get a telegram bot that I can text my stream of consciousness.
- Updating iPad, onboarding to Shapr3D. It's nice and intuitive so far.

**12:20PM**
- Shapr3D set up on all devices
- Got a Telegram bot that funnels my messages to a database that I'll hook to the blog frontend soon. It'll update with my stream of consciousnes and all I have to do is text it.
