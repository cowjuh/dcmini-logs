  <h1>DC Mini Logs</h1>
  <p>
    I keep this logbook for my own sanity. I've left New York in pursuit of
    building a video camera with nothing but a background in engineering, loving
    friends, and conviction that I need what I'm building.
  </p>
  <p>Multiple hypotheses are being tested here:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>I can build a video camera</li>
    <li>Building in public is a good idea</li>
    <li>
      The meta-documentary of documenting its development with itself is a good
      format
    </li>
    <li>
      Going to Taiwan and Shenzhen by myself is a good way to build and test the
      camera
    </li>
    <li>
      Being transparent about what I know (not much) and don't know (most things) is a good
      idea.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    I can't say with confidence how many of these hold true nor that the list is exhaustive, but experimenting will yield something interesting don't you think?
  </p>

  <h1>The Project</h1>
  <p>
    I'm building a video camera in public. I moved to Taiwan (and soon Shenzhen)
    to do it without knowing a single person here. I'm documenting the entire
    process and being honest about not knowing what I'm doing. I got a grant
    from Muze Fund to document it.
  </p>
  <p>
    I speak Mandarin fluently but I have a hard time reading it. I might as well
    be in the second grade but it's okay. Through Pleco, talking to locals,
    getting a 小红书 addiction, I might be able to get by.
  </p>

  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>
    I was recently founding engineer at Kino AI, am a filmmaker, photographer,
    and visual artist. I love learning new pieces of software. Not the web
    stuff, like densely packed desktop software requiring several 3 hour YouTube
    videos to understand. I'm fighting every urge to give this website better
    styling. I have a longstanding tendency to undervalue myself, so I decided
    to stop doing that and give something ambitious a try. Here I am.
